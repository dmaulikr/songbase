And the joy we share, as we tarry there

Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody, that He gives to me
Within my heart is ringing.

And He walks with me and He talks to me 
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share, as we tarry there
None other has ever known.

I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be calling
But He bids me go thro' the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling.

The dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I've sighed for
The fair, sweet morn awakes:
Dark, dark hath been the midnight
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O Christ, He is the fountain
The deep, sweet well of love!
The streams on earth I've tasted
More deep I'll drink above:
There to an ocean fullness
His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth 
In Immanuel's land.

With mercy and with judgment 
My web of time He wove,
And aye, the dews of sorrow 
Were lustered by His love;
I'll bless the hand that guided
I'll bless the heart that planned
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O I am my Beloved's 
And my Beloved is mine!
He brings a poor vile sinner 
Into His "house of wine".
I stand upon His merit
I know no other stand,
Not even where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

The Bride eyes not her garment
But her dear Bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory
But on my King of grace.
Not at the crown He giveth
But on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land

I've wrestled on towards Heaven
Against storm and wind and tide,
Now, like a weary traveller
That leaneth on his guide,
Amid the shades of evening
While sinks life's lingering sand,
I hail the glory dawning
From Immanuel's land.

Prepare the ground for battle, for God's day has come
Drive back the powers of darkness and march to sounding drum

Long years the land lay shrouded, shrouded in defeat
There was the breath of evil there was satan;s seat
But now the winds are blowing, and darkness flees the plain
The power of God is flowing and many are the slain

Hark to the sounding trumpet, hark to the blaring horn
Now is the day of battle, when many shall be born
Sing now the song of Zion, sing loud the swelling praise
Sing of the glorious lion and loud the anthems raise

Praise Him, praise Him Lord of Glory
Praise Him, praise Him Lord of life
See He rides in triumph victorious in the strife

Crown Him Lord of Glory, Crown Him Lord of life
See the Lord of battles victorious in the strife</attribute>

For I am thy God and will still give thee aid.

Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.

When through the deep waters I call thee to go
The rivers of grief shall not thee overflow;
For I will be with thee in trouble to bless
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose
I will not, I will not desert to its foes!
That soul though all hell should endeavour to shake
I’ll never, no, never, no, never forsake!</attribute>

In great sorrow He died:
The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised 
And rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid, 
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgment hall.
Now His suffering affords perfect healing for all. 
This wonderful Healer's mine.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Came the leper to Christ, 
Saying, "Surely I know
That Thou, Lord, canst make me whole."
When his great faith was seen, Jesus said, "Yes, I will,"
And touched him and made him clean.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

He has healed my sick soul, made me every whit whole,
And He'll do the same for you.
He's the same yesterday and today and for aye,
This Healer of men today.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

So far away from home

Just a blanket on the floor
Of that vacant cattle stall
But there the child was born
She held Him in her arms
And as she laid Him down to sleep
She wondered will it always be
So bitter yet so sweet

And did she see there
In the straw by His head a thorn
And did she smell myrrh
In the air on that starry night
And did she hear angels sing
Not so far away
Till at last the sun rose blood red
In the morning sky

And as she watched Him through the years
Her joy was mingled with her tears
And she’d feel it all again 
The glory and the pain
And when the miracles began
She wondered Who is this Man
And where will this all end
Then the words of ancient seers 
Echoed down the centuries
A virgin shall conceive
God with us, Prince of Peace
Man of sorrow strangest name
She wondered time and time again
So bitter yet so sweet

And did she hear angels sing

Till at last the sun rose blood red

My hope is clinging with a perfect trust
To the cross he has borne for me

Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah to the saviour I adore
I will praise him, I will praise him
Hallelujah I will praise him ever more

My soul shouts glory to the Son of God
In his secret place I dwell
His constant presence overshadows me there
And my joy there is none can tell

Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah to the saviour I adore
I will praise him, I will praise him
Hallelujah I will praise him ever more

My soul shouts glory to the  Son of God
And I know it will not be long
Till o'er the river, where the saints have gone
I shall join their eternal song

All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry 
Everything to God in prayer
O what peace we often forfeit
O what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
Take it to the Lord in prayer</attribute>

And myrrh their texture fills
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine
With joy my being thrills

For aloes had a part
And when I think of the cross He bore
My eyes with tear drops start

Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe
Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

His garments too were in cassia dipped
With healing in a touch
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped
He took me from its clutch

Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe
Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

In garments glorious He will come 
To open wide the door
And I shall enter my heavn'ly home
To dwell for ever more

O teach me Lord henceforth with Thee to walk 
In union deep 
Whilst tending other souls not to neglect 
My own to keep 
A separated soul unto the One 
Whose grace and love for me so much have done.

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Nobody stood and applauded them
So they knew from the start
This road would not lead to fame
All they really knew for sure was Jesus had called to them
He said "Come follow me" and they came
With reckless abandon they came

Empty nets lying there at the waters edge
Told a story that few could believe and none could explain
How some crazy fishermen agreed to go where Jesus lead
With no thought for what they would gain
For Jesus had called them by name and they answered

[Chorus:]
We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die
For the sake of the call

Drawn like the rivers are drawn to the sea
No turning back for the water cannot help but flow
Once we hear the Savior's call we'll follow wherever he leads
Because of the love He has shown
And because he has called us to go we will answer

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die

[Bridge:]
Not for the sake of a creed or a cause
Not for a dream or a promise
Simply because it is Jesus who calls
And if we believe we'll obey

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die
For the sake of the call</attribute>

Mighty risen Lord
Clothed in garments pure and holy shining bright
Eyes of flashing fire
Feet like burnished bronze
And the sound of many waters is Your voice

Behold I am alive for ever more

We now see the glory of Your wondrous face
Once that face was marred

Where my faith and real life meet
Sometimes hope seems out of reach
I hear the growing cry for freedom
Am I equal to the call?
Where's the love that conquers all?
It's so easy to be human, so human to give in
But when I reach beyond my weakness
I'm reminded once again

The power is still where it's always been
The Word is alive, Jesus still lives
The power of His blood
Hasn't lessened or dimmed
It's where it's always been
It's where it's always been

Where's the passion for the mission?
Where's the fervour of our faith?
Where's the evidence of grace?
Where's the love that finds compassion
In the sea of human need?
Where's the truth that sets men free?
In a world that holds no answer
Every heart will someday find
That everything they long for
Has been there all the time

The power is still where it's always been
The Word is alive, Jesus still lives
The power of His blood
Hasn't lessened or dimmed
It's where it's always been
It's where it's always been

There's a cross that I can hold to
There's a reason to believe
There's an empty grave that's calling out to me</attribute>

For He that was dead now liveth: 
He liveth for evermore; 
And the gift of new life He giveth, 
As He stands by the open door. 
Come enter the land of His promise, 
Come eat of the corn and the wine: 
For ever our Saviour now liveth, 
And He calls us to come and dine. 

See the pure gold He is bringing, 
And the raiment exceeding fine;
Our thanks we offer in singing, 
And the glory for ever be Thine. 
So, Lord, at they feet lowly bending, 
We take of thy gifts and thy love.  
We take of the grace Thou art sending 
Down from thy throne above.

Praise Him, praise Him, Heaven’s King;
Let the people rise and worship,

Who died and rose on high 
Who died eternal life to bring 
And lives that death may die 

Crown Him the Lord of love
Behold His hands and side 
Those wounds yet visible above 
In beauty glorified 
No angel in the sky 
Can fully bear that sight 
But downward bends His burning eye
At mysteries so bright

Crown Him the Lord of peace
Whose power a sceptre sways 
From pole to pole that wars may cease
And all be prayer and praise 
His reign shall know no end 
And round His pierced feet 
Fair flowers of paradise extend 
Their fragrance ever sweet 

Crown Him the Lord of years 
The Potentate of time 
Creator of the rolling spheres
Ineffably sublime 
All hail Redeemer hail 
For Thou hast died for me 
Thy praise shall never, never fail

When purple morning breaketh
When the bird waketh 
And the shadows flee
Fairer than morning
Lovelier than daylight
Dawns the sweet consciousness
I am with Thee

Alone with Thee
Amid the mystic shadows
The solemn hush of nature newly born
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn

As in the dawning o'er the waveless ocean
The image of the morning star doth rest
So in the stillness Thou beholdest only
Thine image in the waters of my breast

Still, still with Thee
As to each newborn morning
A fresh and solemn splendour still is given
So does this blessed consciousness awaking
Breathe each day nearness
Unto Thee and heaven.

When sinks the soul 
Subdued by toil to slumber
Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer
Sweet the repose beneath thy wings o'er shading
But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there

So shall it be at last
In that bright morning
When the soul waketh 
And life's shadows flee
O in that hour 
Fairer than daylight dawning
Shall rise the glorious thought
I am with Thee

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">There’s a road that is open before us 
And it leads to a world unknown; 
Oft have we pondered its pleasures 
And pictured the heavenly throne. 

We have thought of myriad angels, 
Of harps and of jubilant song; 
We have pictured our Lord and our Saviour 
Where they praise Him all the day long. 

But now our heavenly Guide
Is taking us upward from earth, 
And we’re entering spiritual hallways 
With the sense of a spiritual birth. 

There’s a sensing of realms that we know not 
An acute awareness of need, 
To learn of the things of the Spirit, 
To sit at God’s table and feed. 

The Lamb whom we pictured we see not 
With the eyes of our flesh or our mind, 
But we sense His ineffable nearness 
As He opens the eyes of the blind. 

Instruct us, our God and our Father, 
As we move in this heavenly place;
Teach us the laws of the kingdom 
As we bathe in Thy glory and grace. 

Set our minds firmly on Jesus 
As we search for that radiant face; 
Let our feet go fervently forward 
As we seek for that uttermost place. 

Chorus
Sing we now the song of Jesus, 
Let the vaults of heaven ring, 
Let all nations come and worship 
At the throne of heaven’s king. 

Seek we now the joy of Jesus, 
Seek the deepest wells of life; 
Let us rise and take the kingdom, 
Rise victorious in the strife.</attribute>

Fixed on the Lamb who was crucified

You'll reign at Your Father's side 

And the angels will cry "Hail the Lamb 
Who was slain for the world rule in power"
And the earth will reply "You shall reign 
As the King of all kings and the Lord of all Lords"

There's a shield in our hand 
And a sword at our side 
There's a fire in our spirit 
That cannot be denied 
As the Father has told us 
For these You have died 
For the nations that gather before You 
And the ears of all men need to hear 
Of the Lamb who was crucified 
Who descended to hell yet was raised up

Kneel down on the shore
Be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified

Follow Christ to the holy mountain
Sinner, sorry and wrecked by the fall
Cleanse your heart and your soul
In the fountain that flows
For you and for me and for all

At the wonderful tragic mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white
On that beautiful scandalous night

On the hillside you will be delivered
At the foot of the cross justified
And your spirit restored
By the river that pours
From our blessed Saviour’s side

At the wonderful tragic mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white
On that beautiful scandalous night

Go on up to the mountain of mercy
To the crimson perpetual tide
Kneel down on the shore be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified

On that beautiful scandalous night you and me

And now He reigns triumphant, the goodly crown is won. 
All glory to the Saviour, all glory to the Son.

See the Lamb that once was slain
See on His palms is carv'd your name
See how our pain has pierc'd His heart
And on His brow He bears our pride
A crown of thorns

But only love pours from His heart
As silently He takes the blame
He has my name upon His lips
My condemnation falls on Him
This love is marvellous to me
His sacrifice has set me free
And now I live

Led by grace that love to know 
Spirit breathing from above 
Thou hast taught me it is so 
O this full and perfect peace
O this transport all divine 
In a love which cannot cease 
I am His and He is mine 

Heaven above is softer blue
Earth around is sweeter green 
Something lives in every hue
Christless eyes have never seen 
Birds with gladder songs o'erflow 
Flowers with deeper beauties shine 
Since I know as now I know 
I am His and He is mine

Things that once were wild alarms 
Cannot now disturb my rest 
Closed in everlasting arms
Pillowed on the loving breast
O to lie for ever here
Doubt and care and self resign 
While He whispers in my ear
I am His and He is mine

His for ever only His 
Who the Lord and me shall part 
Ah with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart 
Heaven and earth may fade and flee
Firstborn light in gloom decline 
But while God and I shall be
I am His and He is mine </attribute>

With the crucified
Temples of the Spirit
Saved and sanctified
Set apart for service
By God's hand ordained
We the cross have taken
By His love constrained

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Christ the veil has entered 
With the blood He shed
Sin's great debt is cancelled
Love's own feast is spread
Now in Christ we're chosen 
Kings and priests to be
Living offerings bringing 
His own blood our plea

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Like a boundless ocean 
Ever rolling in
Comes this flood of blessing
Seeking lives to win
Who such love can fathom 
From God's heart which flows
Or such grace e'er measure
Which His hand bestows

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Pressing onward upward
Life grows pure and strong
Tis the vision splendid 
Saves from all that's wrong
In the steps of Jesus 
We would plant our own
Blessed path of triumph 
Leading to the throne

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Gathered by the crystal sea.

I was lost, but Jesus found me,
Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me,
Drew me back into His way.

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me,
Sing it with the saints in glory,
Gathered by the crystal sea.

I was bruised, but Jesus healed me,
Faint was I from many a fall,
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,
But He freed me from them all.

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me,
Sing it with the saints in glory,
Gathered by the crystal sea.
 
He will keep me till the river 
Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He'll bear me safely over,
Where the loved ones I shall meet.

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story

Sing it with the saints in glory,

Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive, 
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve 
Because Thy promise I believe 
O Lamb of God, I come, I come 

Just as I am, Thy love unknown 
Has broken every barrier down 
Now to be Thine, yea Thine alone,

The breadth, length, depth and height to prove 
Here for a season, then above

Of the coming of the Lord 
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored 
He hath loosed the fateful lightning 
Of His terrible swift sword 
His truth is marching on 

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on

He has sounded forth the trumpet 
That shall never sound retreat 
He is sifting out the hearts of men 
Before His judgement seat 
O be swift my soul to answer Him 
Be jubilant my feet 
Our God is marching on

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Our God is marching on

In the beauty of the lilies 
Christ was born across the sea 
With a glory in His bosom 
That transfigures you and me 
As He died to make men holy 
Let us live to make men free 
While God is marching on 

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
While God is marching on

He is coming like the glory 
Of the morning on the wave 
He is wisdom to the mighty 
He is succour to the brave 
All the world shall be His footstool 
And the sword of time His slave 
Our God is marching on

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Our God is marching on

When the clouds unfold their wings of strife
When the strong tides lift and the cables strain
Will you anchor drift or firm remain?

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love

It is safely moored, 'twill the storm withstand
For 'tis well secured by the Saviour's hand
And the cables passed from His heart to mine
Can defy the blast, through strength divine

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love

It will firmly hold in the straits of fear
When the breakers have told the reef is near
Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow
Not and angry wave shall our bark o'erflow

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love

It will surely hold in the floods of death
When the waters cold, chill our latest breath
On the rising tide it can never fail
While our hopes abide within the veil

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love

When our eyes behold, through the gathering night
The city of gold, our harbour bright
We shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore
With the storms all past for evermore

Great David's greater Son
Hail, in the time appointed
His reign on earth begun
He comes to break oppression
To set the captive free
To take away transgression
And rule in equity

He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth
And love, joy, hope, like flowers
Spring in His path to birth
Before Him on the mountains
Shall peace, the herald, go
And righteousness, in fountains
From hill to valley flow

Kings shall fall down before Him
And gold and incense bring
All nations shall adore Him
His praise all people sing
For He shall have dominion
O'er river, sea and shore
For as the eagle's pinion
Or dove's light wing can soar

He comes with succour speedy
To those who suffer wrong
To help the poor and needy
And bid the weak be strong
To give them songs for sighing
Their darkness turn to light
Whose souls, condemned and dying
Were precious in His sight

O'er every foe victorious
He on His throne shall rest
From age to age more glorious
All-blessing and all-blest
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove
His Name shall stand for ever
His changeless Name of Love</attribute>

his hand the wonders wrought.

This is my Father's world, 
the birds their carols raise, 
the morning light, the lily white, 
declare their maker's praise.  
This is my Father's world:  
he shines in all that's fair; 
in the rustling grass I hear him pass; 
he speaks to me everywhere.

This is my Father's world.  
let me ne'er forget 
that though the wrong seems oft so strong, 
God is the ruler yet.  
This is my Father's world:  
why should my heart be sad?  
The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!  
God reigns; let the earth be glad!

Should set His love upon the sons of men 
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers
To bring them back they know not how or when 
But this I know that He was born of Mary 
When Bethlehem's manger was His only home 
And that He lived at nazareth and laboured 
And so the Saviour, 
Saviour of the world is come 

I cannot tell how silently He suffered 
As with His peace he graced this place of tears 
Or how His heart upon the cross was broken 
The crown of pain to three and thirty years 
But this I know He heals the broken-hearted 
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear 
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden 
For yet the Saviour Saviour of the world is here 

I cannot tell how He will win the nations 
How He will claim His earthly heritage 
How satisfy the needs and aspirations 
Of east and west of sinner and of sage 
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory 
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown 
And some glad day 
His sun shall shine in splendour 
When He the Saviour,
Saviour of the world is known 

I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship 
When at his bidding every storm is stilled 
Or who can say how great the jubilation 
When all the hearts of men with love are filled 
But this I know the skies will thrill with rapture 
And myriad myriad human voices sing 
And earth to heaven 
And heaven to earth will answer

Saviour of the world is King!" </attribute>

The desert shall blossom as fresh as the rose 
This river brings healing wherever it flows 
The ground that is parched so thirsty and dry 
Shall surely be flooded with rain from on high 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

The deaf shall have hearing 
The blind folk shall see 
The lame shall be loosed from their infirmity 
The crooked made straight 
And the broken made whole 
This latter time blessing as promised by Joel 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

The fetters of fear and of doubt soon shall break 
When unbelief goes and the church shall awake 
The chains of hard bondage forever will fall 
And Jesus exalted supreme over all 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

By this flowing river earth's bondage shall cease 
The floods are now rising to bring us release 
The vision is glorious then why not believe
Step into the blessing His fullness receive

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

For me it was in the garden
He prayed not My will, but Thine
He had no fears for His own griefs
But sweat drops of blood for mine

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

In pity angels beheld Him
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows 
He bore for my soul that night

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own
He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
'Twill be  my joy through the ages

Take my silver and my gold;

Take my heart, it is Thine own;

It is the night of our dear Saviour’s birth 
Long lay the world in sin and darkness pining
Till He appeared gift of infinite worth 
Behold the babe in yonder manger lowly 
'Tis God's own Son come down in human form
Fall on your knees behold the Lord most Holy 

O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine 

With humble hearts we bow in adoration 
Before this Child gift of God's matchless love 
Sent from on high to purchase our salvation 
That we might dwell with Him ever above 
What grace untold to leave the bliss of glory 
And die for sinners guilty and forlorn 
Fall on your knees repeat the wondrous story 

O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine 

O day of Joy when in eternal splendour 
He shall return in His glory to reign 
When every tongue due praise to Him shall render 
His power and might to all nations proclaim 
A thrill of hope the longing heart rejoices 
For soon shall dawn that glad eternal morn 
Fall on your knees with joy lift up your voices

And when you arrive, nobody knows
But the Father in heaven, He's glad you can go
For those who come after you will need the road

Bigger and better, and faster than you
But you can't look back, no you gotta keep pressing through

All across the land 
Fragrant breeze of heaven 
Blowing once again 
Don't know where it comes from 
Don't know where it goes 
But let it blow over me 
O sweet wind come and blow over me 

There's a rain a-pouring
Showers from above 
Mercy drops are coming
Mercy drops of love 
Turn your face to heaven 
Let the water pour 
Well let it pour over me 
O sweet rain come and pour over me 

There's a fire burning
Falling from the sky 
Awesome tongues of fire
Consuming you and I 
Can you feel it burning 
Burn the sacrifice 
Well let it burn over me  
O sweet fire come and burn over me

And make His paths straight in the wilderness
And let your light shine in the darkness
And let your rain fall in the desert.

As sure as gold is precious and the honey sweet,
So you love this city and you love these streets.
Every child out playing by their own front door
Every baby laying on the bedroom floor.

Every dreamer dreaming in her dead-end job
Every driver driving through the rush hour mob
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones
You're going to send revival, bring them all back home

I can hear that thunder in the distance
Like a train on the edge of town
I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit
"Lay your burdens down, Lay your burdens down".

From the Preacher preaching when the well is dry
To the lost soul reaching for a higher high
From the young man working through his hopes and fears
To the widow walking through the veil of tears

Every man and woman, every old and young
Every fathers daughter, every mothers son.
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones
You're going to send revival, bring them all back home

I can hear that thunder in the distance
Like a train on the edge of town
I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit
"Lay your burdens down, Lay your burdens down".

At home with the Lord I shall be.

Consider all the works Thy hand hath made
I see the stars I hear the mighty thunder 
Thy power throughout the universe display'd 

Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art 
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

And when I think 
That God His Son not sparing 
Sent Him to die
I scarce can take it in 
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing 
He bled and died to take away my sin 

Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art 
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

When Christ shall come 
With shout of acclamation 
And take me home 
What joy shall fill my heart 
Then shall I bow in humble adoration 
And there proclaim my God how great Thou art

Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee

And grace my fears relieved

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
Tis grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will be shield and portion be
As long as life endures

Yes when this heart and flesh shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace

Ashamed I hear my mocking voice 
Call out among the scoffers 
It was my sin that held Him there 
Until it was accomplished 
His dying breath has brought me life

Lovely illusions they never come true

And life lies before us 
Like an unexplored adventure 
Time seems like a promise 
That we hold within our hand 
But we rarely understand 

That time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away 

To live to love we set our goals 
Never to be chained 
But be blown by winds of fancy 
Freedom is our promise 
And we hold it in our hand 
But we're building on the sand 

For time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away 

'Till a high and holy call 
Falls on our cherished youthful days
And we realise that time is slipping by 
Fading into misted memory 
While Jesus stands and whispers 
Follow me, follow me

And time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away

In all of this confusion
Who will rage against the night
And who will light a beacon
In the face of this dark dark sky

Where there is oppression 
Who will raise the flame 
For the sake of all the children
Who will touch the fields of shame
And who will light a beacon
In the face of this dark dark sky
With a hope that is eternal
With a love that will never die

O I, I will carry the fire (repeat)

Who will burn with passion
Blazing from the heart
To forge a new tomorrow
We must tell the world
Of a hope that is eternal
Of a love that will never die
And we will light a beacon
In the face of this dark dark sky

O I, I will carry the fire (repeat)
I will not rest, I will not tire
With all my strength I'll carry the fire
I will not rest, I will not tire
With all my strength, I'll carry the fire</attribute>

Waiting for You to pass by 
You put Your hand over his face 
So in Your presence he wouldn't die 
All of Israel saw the glory 
And it shines down through the age 
Now You've called me to boldly seek Your face 

Show me Your face, Lord 
Show me Your face 
And draw back the veil
That I might stand in this holy place 
Show me Your face, Lord 
Your power and grace 
I could make it to the end if I can just see Your face 

David knew there was something more 
Than the ark of Your presence 
And in a manger a baby was born 
Among kings and peasants 
All of Israel saw the glory 
And it shines down through the age 
And now You call us to boldly seek Your face 

Show me Your face, Lord

No matter what others may say,

To come and be filled with love never ending
You’re always welcome at the table of grace.

So come you weak, and heavy hearted
Don’t try to hide your earthly scars.
In His eyes, we all are equal
Don’t be afraid, come as you are.

At the table of grace the cup’s never empty.
The plate’s always full, and it’s never too late.
To come and be filled with love never ending
You’re always welcome at the table of grace.

So let the first become the last
Let the poor put kings to shame.
Their willing hearts will be their treasure
By the power of Jesus’ name!

At the table of grace the cup’s never empty
The plate’s always full, and it’s never too late!
To come and be filled with love never ending
You’re always welcome at the table of grace

Blessed be Your name

And blessed be Your name,
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be Your name

Every blessing You pour out
I’ll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say,
“Lord blessed be Your name”.

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

Let angel minds inquire no more

Fast bound in sin and nature's night

I woke the dungeon flamed with light 
My chains fell off my heart was free
I rose went forth and followed Thee 

No condemnation now I dread 
Jesus and all in Him is mine 
Alive in Him my living head
And clothed in righteousness divine 
Bold I approach the eternal throne
And claim the crown through

I heard that last triumphant cry 
And now at last the truth is known 
He is alive my Son my Son 

Mary lift your eyes and see 
Mary Son of hope is He 
Open to the light that falls 
Open to the song that calls 

Mary rise into the light 
Windsong rises in the darkest night 
Blows its message through the morning sky 
He is alive Christ can never die 

Hear it in the whisper of the wind 
See it in the brightening of the sky 
Feel it in the trembling of the earth 
He is alive Christ can never die 

Breaking heaven's glory 
Calling into the night 
Softly shining of dawn light 
Holy glory of light

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Once our blessed Christ of beauty 
Was veiled off from human view;
But through suffering death and sorrow 
He has rent the veil in two. 

O behold the man of sorrows, 
O behold Him in plain view, 
Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

Yes, He is with God, the Father, 
Interceding there for you;
For He is the Mighty Conqueror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

O behold the man of sorrows, 
O behold Him in plain view, 
Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

Holy angels bow before Him, 
Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the well beloved, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

O behold the man of sorrows, 
O behold Him in plain view, 
Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

Throughout time and endless ages, 
Heights and depths of love so true;
He alone can be the giver, 
Since He rent the veil in two 

O behold the man of sorrows, 
O behold Him in plain view, 
Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. </attribute>

As men from every tongue

All the angels are crying holy 
To the lamb who sits upon the throne 
Holy holy God Almighty 
Who was who is and is to come 
All creation is bringing glory

I see One who's full of wonder
Eyes of fire and voice of thunder
Shining bright His majesty
All the colours of the rainbow
Circle Him and fill His temple
Beautiful this is to me

On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss 
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it Lord that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my Lord:
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet ,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

Well the heart is deceitful above all, Sir

By the blood of Jesus 
A life of sin washed clean away 
By the blood of Jesus 

There is power 
In His precious blood 
To overcome the evil one
 
Born to die we live instead
By the blood of Jesus 
A life of sin washed clean away 
By the blood of Jesus

No fragrant morning noon or dappled ev'ning
Compare in any facet with the Son 

Beloved Son cherished of the Father 
Redeemed Thine own creation with Thy blood 
Restoring man belov'd of God the Father 
Reviled and placed upon a cross of wood 

Now have I seen Thee in the sanctu'ry 
O God most high more dear than any one 
Resplendent Lord surpassing thought or concept
Receive the sacrifice of Thine own Son 

Within these walls of time we live and move 
Receding limits as we gaze on Thee 
For through the flesh of our imperfect being 
There breaketh knowledge of Eternity 

So shall I praise Thee love Thee and adore
Till life is through and limits lose their hold 
And standing there at last alone before Thee 
My praises shall for ever more unfold

Jesus my saviour, be with me always.

A perfect commandment: love every man.
And morning the third day, He rose to life again
That we might be saved from sin
And in His light new life begin

Although I must leave you, you will not be alone.
The Spirit will greet you, His power will make you strong

Saviour Divine
For Thou art all to me 
And I am Thine
Is there on earth a closer bond than this
That my beloved's mine and I am His

Thine am I by all ties
But chiefly Thine 
That through Thy sacrifice
Thou Lord art mine
By Thine own cords of love so sweetly wound
Around me I to Thee am closely bound

To Thee, Thou dying Lamb 
I all things owe
All that I have and am
And all I know
All that I have is now no longer mine
And I am not my own, Lord I am Thine

How can I Lord withhold
Life's brightest hour
From Thee or gathered gold
Or any power?
Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee
When Thou hast given Thine own dear self for me

I pray Thee Saviour keep
Me in thy love
Until death's holy sleep
Shall me remove
To that fair realm where, sin and sorrow o'er
Thou and Thine own are one for evermore

Sat the ark of the covenant 
Where the most high dwells

Revealing the holy place 
On a hill nearby on a rugged cross 
Justice met grace

I can kneel and make my petition known 
I can go into the holy of holies
And although I'm just a common man 
Because of God's redemption plan 
I can boldly approach the throne 

For the blood of sacrifices 
Is now no longer required 
For the blood of Christ God's spotless Lamb 
Has opened heaven's door

Declaring the word of the Lord 
And these are the days of
Your servant Moses 
Righteousness being restored 
And though these are days of great trial 
Of famine and darkness and sword 
Still we are a voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord

Behold He comes riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call 
Lift your voice the year of jubilee 
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes 

These are the days of Ezekiel 
The dry bones becoming as flesh 
And these are the days
Of your servant David 
Rebuilding the temple of praise 
And these are the days of the harvest 
The fields are as white in your world 
And we are the labourers 
In your vineyard 
Declaring the word of the Lord

Behold He comes riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call 
Lift your voice the year of jubilee 
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes

Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood 
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see 
That fountain in his day
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away.

I do believe I will believe 
That Jesus died for me 
That on the cross He shed His blood 
From sin to set me free 
From sin to set me free 
From sin to set me free 
That on the cross He shed His blood 
From sin to set me free 

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Be saved, to sin no more.

E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream 
Thy flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die.</attribute>

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Come Holy Spirit we await You: 
Come in all Your sovereign power;
This is the day the Lord has chosen,
This is the day and this the hour. 

Come, gentle Spirit, we await You: 
Come in all your holy grace; 
Show us now the things of Jesus, 
Show us now His Blessed face. 

Come, Holy Spirit, we can feel You 
Falling on us like a shower; 
Bless we now the name of Jesus, 
Thrill we now with holy power. 

Come, Holy Spirit, we can sense You: 
Coming like the gentle rain; 
Love a mantle falling on us
Sing we now our glad refrain. 

Take the things that shade His glory:
Pierce the clouds that lie between; 
Convict of sin, O Holy Spirit, 
That His glory may be seen. 

Come, Holy Spirit, to release us: 
Bind our wounds and set us free; 
Break the cruel bands of darkness, 
As thy glorious light we see. 

Lift the burdens, Holy Spirit: 
Heal the scars and staunch the pain, 
By the precious blood of Jesus,
Through the Lamb who once was slain. 

Chorus 
Sing we now the song of Jesus, 
Praise we now the stricken Lamb;
Unctioned by the Holy Spirit, 
Praise we now the great I Am.</attribute>

We have prayed to You for rain
We have cried for Your compassion
To renew the land again
Now we're standing in Your presence 
More hungry than before
Now we're on the steps of mercy
And we're knocking at Your door.

How long, before You drench the barren land?
How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy?

Lord we know Your heart is broken
By the evil that You see
And you've stayed Your hand of judgement
For You plan to set men free.
But the land is still in darkness
And we've fled from what is right
We have failed the silent children
Who will never see the light.

How long, before You drench the barren land?
How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy?

But I know a day is coming
When the deaf will hear His voice
When the blind will see their Saviour
And the lame will leap for joy.
When the widow finds a Husband
Who will always love His bride
And the orphan finds a Father
Who will never leave her side. 

How long, before Your glory lights the skies?
How long, before Your radiance lifts our eyes?
How long, before Your fragrance fills the air?
How long, before the earth resounds with songs of joy?

So great a cloud of witnesses

The needy and the hurt
The lowly and the humble
Shall inherit all the earth

And for everyone who called in vain
While injustice raised its head
For the ones who cried in hunger
And yet could not be fed
There shall come a new beginning
They shall all be glorified

By His blood are standing by His side

In the Spirit of the Lord
Clothe us with Salvation
Robes of purest white
The body of Messiah
We are precious in the sight

Even so, even so, even so
Lord Jesus come
All creation cries for the returning of our King
Come take Your place on Your throne Jerusalem

Let the Spirit and the Bride say come
Let the Spirit and the Bride say come
To the lion and the lamb 
Heaven’s King the great I Am
Come and take Your place 
On Your throne Jerusalem

Even so, even so, even so
Lord Jesus come
All creation cries for the returning of our King
Come take Your place on Your throne Jerusalem

Sound the trumpet
Heaven's gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

On a day like today
Heaven and earth will pass away
In a moment suddenly
Comes the sound of jubilee

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heaven's gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

Conscious now of earthly things
'Till we see the King of Kings
Such a long time so it seemed
Now hear the song of the redeemed

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heaven's gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

In this day in which we stand
We cry out from every land
Songs of triumph
Songs of love
One day we will sing above

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heaven's gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

Thank you for this day of grace
'Till we see You face to face
Hasten Lord the wedding day
When we meet You in the way

He is coming He is returning

I live in Christ alone
This precious mystery, once hidden now revealed
The hope of glory now

No longer I who lives, no longer I who fears
No longer hopeless, defeated or cast down
For Christ He lives in me

And I call upon the Name above all names
In Jesus Christ I stand
A confession of the saving grace of God
Through the blood of Jesus Christ

No longer I who lives, no longer I who fears
No longer hopeless, defeated or cast down
For Christ He lives in me

The life of God has reached me from the cross
My sins now buried there
Where no memory or condemnations power

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life, and health, and peace.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.

Where faithful ones from every tongue

Made faultless through the Lamb

Their thunderous anthem rings
Through emerald courts and sapphire skies

All glory, wisdom, power
Strength, thanks and honour are
To God our King who reigns on high
For evermore

And there we'll find our home
Our life before the throne
We'll honour Him in perfect song
Where we belong
He'll wipe each tear-stained eye
As thirst and hunger die
The Lamb becomes our Shepherd King
We'll reign with Him

I've heard them say, that morning, that the earth began to shake

Repeat

Alive, alive, dead but now arisen
He's alive, alive, living now in heaven
As we wait for Him to come again some day
The people say, He is alive

Come one and all to wonder at the grave they laid Him in
Come see the tomb is empty, He has triumphed over sin
The power of death has been defeated and forgiven now we sing
O hear us sing, He's risen from the dead

Alive, alive, dead but now arisen
He's alive, alive, living now in heaven
As we wait for Him to come again some day
The people say He is alive

Beaten, rejected, crucified
Scorned and afflicted
Left to die
Risen, victorious, King of life
Saviour, Redeemer, Jesus Christ

Alive, alive, dead but now arisen
He's alive, alive, living now in heaven

How pure the soul must be
When, placed within Thy searching sight
It shrinks not, but, with calm delight
Can live, and look on Thee

The spirits that surround Thy throne
May bear the burning bliss
But that is surely theirs alone
Since they have never, never known
A fallen world like this

O how shall I, whose native sphere
Is dark, whose mind is dim
Before the Ineffable appear
And on my naked spirit bear
The uncreated beam?

There is a way for man to rise
To that sublime abode
An offering and a sacrifice
A Holy Spirit's energies
An advocate with God

These, these prepare us for the sight
Of Holiness above
The sons of ignorance and night
May dwell in the eternal light
Through the eternal Love

This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled when strivings cease
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I stand.</attribute>

In an upper room 
Waiting for God's power from on high 
They were waiting for a promise
Made not so long before 
Jesus said He'd come  
And set their souls on fire 
Suddenly the sound of wind came rushing in 
And their hearts were set aflame 
And to them He gave the power
When they called upon His name 

Suddenly, I can feel His mighty power 
Suddenly, I can feel a change within 
And I know that I will never 
Never be the same again 
You can find all you need at the altar 
Leave behind every weight that presses in 
For the Spirit of the Lord is still moving suddenly 

Never let your heart be troubled
No need to be afraid 
When you feel you don't have
Strength to carry on 
There is glory in God's presence
There is healing in His love 
He's our anchor and our peace in every storm 
So my friend call on the Lord 
And trust His word 
From age to age He's still the same 
For He's a God who loves us
A God who hears us 
There's power in His name 

Suddenly, I can feel His mighty power 
Suddenly, I can feel a change within 
And I know that I will never 
Never be the same again

A day I will never forget
After I wandered in darkness away
Jesus my saviour I met
O, what a tender compassionate Friend
He met the need of my heart
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My Saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's family divine
Justified fully thro' Calvary's love
O what a standing is mine
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer
He saved me O praise His dear name

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My Saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time
I have a future in heaven for sure
There in those mansions sublime
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My Saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

With its crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God?

Gather with the saints at the river
That flows from the throne of God.

On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy golden day.

Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river;
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows from the throne of God.

Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river;
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows from the throne of God.

Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver,
With the melody of peace.

A throne of great renown
Where men have come to worship
Upon this holy ground
And this oil has not departed
Nor the meal to feed the young
But the Lord has spoken clearly
Of the glory yet to come

And now rolling like a river
Ever deep and ever wide
Shining bright from out of Heaven
Comes a living crystal tide

See the fire on the horizon
Burning holy in the night
See the King of all of Heaven
Striding swiftly to the fight

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

When are banished grief and pain
When the crooked ways are straightened
And the dark things shall be plain

Face to face shall I behold Him

Face to face in all His glory

While in affliction's furnace, 
And passing through the fire,  
Thy love we praise, 
Which knows our days 
And ever brings us nigher. 
We clap our hands exulting
In Thine almighty favour;
The love divine which made us Thine,
Shall keep us Thine for ever. 

By faith we see the glory 
To which Thou shalt restore us; 
The Cross despise for that high prize 
Which Thou has set before us. 
And if Thou count us worthy, 
We each, as dying Stephen, 
Shall see Thee stand 
At God's right hand 
To take us up to heaven.

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Come O come and fill this temple 
Fill this temple with the glory of the Lord 
Come O come and fill this temple 
Fill this temple with the glory of the Lord 

There's a place of unity 
A place for fellowship 
There's a place where God's people
Come together 
When the Spirit of the Lord descends 
And binds our hearts as one 
And we're filled afresh with Holy power 
(Lift your voices to the Lord)

Come O come and fill this temple 
Fill this temple with the glory of the Lord 
Come O come and fill this temple 
Fill this temple with the glory of the Lord 

So we wait with open arms 
We're hungry for your touch 
And we worship now the name of Jesus
Forgive us Lord for grieving You 
And warm our hearts anew 
With the fire and the zeal of Pentecost
(Let your voices rise again) 

Come O come and fill this temple 
Fill this temple with the glory of the Lord 
Come O come and fill this temple 
Fill this temple with the glory of the Lord </attribute>

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">O God of burning cleansing flame 
Send the fire 
Your blood-bought gift today we claim 
Send the fire today 
Look down and see this waiting host 
And send the promised Holy Ghost 
We need another Pentecost 
Send the fire today x 2   

God of Elijah hear our cry
Send the fire 
And make us fit to live or die 
Send the fire today
To burn up every trace of sin 
To bring the light and glory in 
The revolution now begin 
Send the fire today x 2  

It's fire we want for fire we plead 
Send the fire 
The fire will meet our every need 
Send the fire today 
For strength to always do what's right
For grace to conquer in the fight 
For power to walk the world in white 
Send the fire today x 2  

To make our weak hearts 
Strong and brave 
Send the fire 
To live a dying world to save 
Send the fire today 
O see us on Your altar lay 
We give our lives to you today 
So crown the offering now we pray 
Send the fire today x 3

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Morning by morning I wake up to find 
The power and comfort of God’s hand in mine 
Season by season I watch Him, amazed 
In awe of the mystery of His perfect ways 
All I have need of, His hand will provide 
He’s always been faithful to me. 

I can’t remember a trial or a pain 
He did not recycle to bring me gain 
I can’t remember one single regret 
In serving God only, and trusting His hand 
All I have need of, His hand will provide 
He’s always been faithful to me. 

This is my anthem, this is my song 
The theme of the stories I’ve heard for so long 
God has been faithful, He will be again 
His loving compassion, it knows no end 
All I have need of, His hand will provide 
He’s always been faithful, He’s always been faithful 
He’s always been faithful to me.
