        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">He wraps Himself in light, as with a garment
He spreads out the heavens
And walks on the wings of the wind.
He sends forth the springs from the valleys
They flow between mountains
The birds of the air, dwell by the waters
Lifting their voices in song. 

Singing glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
All praises and honour, forever

He made the moon for it's seasons
The sun knows its settings
He looks at the earth and it trembles,
He touches the mountains and they smoke
I will sing to the Lord all my life,
I will sing praises to my God
As long as I live
Praises to the Lord, oh my soul. 

Singing glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
All praises and honour, forever

Singing glory, hallelujah, glory to our God
	All praises and honour, forever. </attribute>

Endless is the vict'ry 
Thou o'er death hast won 
Angels in bright raiment
Rolled the stone away 
Kept the folded grave clothes

Lovingly He greets us 
Scatters fear and gloom 
Let the Church with gladness
Hymns of triumph sing 
For Her Lord now liveth 
Death hath lost its sting 

No more we doubt Thee

Life is naught without 
Thee aid us in our strife 
Make us more than conquerors
Through Thy deathless love 
Bring us safe through Jordan

Led by grace that love to know 
Spirit breathing from above 
Thou hast taught me it is so 
Oh this full and perfect peace
Oh this transport all divine

I am His and He is mine 

Heaven above is softer blue
Earth around is sweeter green

Christless eyes have never seen 
Birds with gladder songs o'erflow 
Flowers with deeper beauties shine 
Since I know as now I know 
I am His and He is mine

Things that once were wild alarms 
Cannot now disturb my rest 
Closed in everlasting arms
Pillowed on the loving breast
Oh to lie for ever here
Doubt and care and self resign 
While He whispers in my ear
I am His and He is mine

His for ever only His 
Who the Lord and me shall part 
Ah with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart 
Heaven and earth may fade and flee
Firstborn light in gloom decline 
But while God and I shall be

Hear me when I cry 
Lord do not hide
Your face from me 
You have been my strength 
You have been my shield 
And You will lift me up

One thing I desire

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Called to separation 
With the crucified
Temples of the Spirit
Saved and sanctified
Set apart for service
By God's hand ordained
We the cross have taken
By His love constrained

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Christ the veil has entered 
With the blood He shed
Sin's great debt is cancelled
Love's own feast is spread
Now in Christ we're chosen 
Kings and priests to be
Living offerings bringing 
His own blood our plea
Like a boundless ocean 
Ever rolling in
Comes this flood of blessing
Seeking lives to win
Who such love can fathom 
From God's heart which flows
Or such grace e'er measure
Which His hand bestows

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Pressing onward upward
Life grows pure and strong
Tis the vision splendid 
Saves from all that's wrong
In the steps of Jesus 
We would plant our own
Blessed path of triumph 
Leading to the throne

Now we're on the steps of mercy

How long, before You drench the barren land?
How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy.

Lord we know Your heart is broken
By the evil that You see
And you've stayed Your hand of judgement
For You plan to set men free.
But the land is still in darkness
And we've fled from what is right
We have failed the silent children
Who will never see the light.

But I know a day is coming
When the deaf will hear His voice
When the blind will see their Saviour
And the lame will leap for joy.
When the widow finds a Husband
Who will always love His bride
And the orphan finds a Father
Who will never leave her side. 

How long, before Your glory lights the skies?
How long, before Your radiance lifts our eyes?
How long, before Your fragrance fills the air?
How long, before the earth resounds with songs of joy?

And life lies before us 
Like an unexplored adventure 
Time seems like a promise 
That we hold within our hands 
But we rarely understand 

That time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away 

To live to love we set our goals 
Never to be chained 
But be blown by winds of fancy 
Freedom is our promise 
And we hold it in our hands 
But we're building on the sand 

That time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away 

Till a high and holy call 
Falls on our cherished youthful days
And we realise that time is slipping by 
Fading into misted memory 
While Jesus stands and whispers 
Follow me follow me

That time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away

Let angel minds inquire no more

Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race 
Tis mercy all, immense and free
For O my God it found out me! 

Long my imprisoned spirit lay 
Fast bound in sin and nature's night 
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray 
I woke the dungeon flamed with light 
My chains fell off my heart was free
I rose went forth and followed Thee

In an upper room 
Waiting for God's power from on high 
They were waiting for a promise
Made not so long before 
Jesus said He'd come  
And set their souls on fire 
Suddenly the sound of wind came rushing in 
And their hearts were set aflame 
And to them He gave the power
When they called upon His name 

Suddenly, I can feel His mighty power 
Suddenly I can feel a change within 
And I know that I will never 
Never be the same again 
You can find all you need at the altar 
Leave behind every weight that presses in 
For the Spirit of the Lord is still moving suddenly 

Never let your heart be troubled
No need to be afraid 
When you feel you don't have
Strength to carry on 
There is glory in His presence
There is healing in His love 
He's our anchor and our peace in every storm 
So my friend call on the Lord 
And trust His word 
From age to age He's still the same 
For He's a God who loves us
A God who hears us 
There's power in His name

O what a foretaste of glory divine 
Heir of salvation purchase of God 
Born of His Spirit washed in His blood

This is my story this is my song 
Praising my Saviour all the day long

Praising my Saviour all the day long 

Perfect submission perfect delight 
Visions of rapture burst on my sight 
Angels descending bring from above 
Echoes of mercy whispers of love 

This is my story this is my song 
Praising my Saviour all the day long 
This is my story this is my song 
Praising my Saviour all the day long 

Perfect submission all is at rest 
I in my Saviour am happy and blessed 
Watching and waiting looking above 
Filled with His goodness lost in His love 

This is my story this is my song 
Praising my Saviour all the day long

There from His opened side
Poured forth the crimson tide

Cleansed is my heart within

Gone are my grief and care
Christ bore my burdens there

Glorious His victory

When Bethlehem's manger was His only home 
And that He lived at nazareth and laboured 
And so the Saviour, 
Saviour of the world is come 

I cannot tell how silently He sufferd 
As with His peace he graced this place of tears 
Or how His heart upon the cross was broken 
The crown of pain to three and thirty years 
But this I know He heals the broken-hearted 
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear 
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden 
For yet the Saviour Saviour of the world is here 

I cannot tell how He will win the nations 
How He will claim His earthly heritage 
How satisfy the needs and aspirations 
Of east and west of sinner and of sage 
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory 
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown 
And some glad day 
His sun shall shine in splendour 
When He the Saviour,
Saviour of the world is known 

I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship 
When at his bidding every storm is stilled 
Or who can say how great the jubilation 
When all the hearts of men with love are filled 
But this I know the skies will thrill with rapture 
And myriad myriad human voices sing 
And earth to heaven 
And heaven to earth will answer 
"At last the Saviour, 
Saviour of the world is King!" </attribute>

The Lamb that was slain 
You ascended to heaven
And ever more will reign 
At the end of the age 
When the earth You reclaim 
You will gather the nations before You 
And the eyes of all men will be 
Fixed on the Lamb who was crucified 
For with wisdom and mercy and justice 
You'll reign at Your Father's side 

And the angels will cry "Hail the Lamb 
Who was slain for the world rule in power"
And the earth will reply "You shall reign 
As the King of all kings and the Lord of all Lords"

There's a shield in our hand 
And a sword at our side 
There's a fire in our spirit 
That cannot be denied 
As the Father has told us 
For these You have died 
For the nations that gather before You 
And the ears of all men need to hear 
Of the Lamb who was crucified 
Who descended to hell yet was raised up 
To reign at the Father's side

The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised

This Jesus of Calvary.

Chorus
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid, 
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgment hall.
Now His suffering affords perfect healing for all. 
This wonderful Healer's mine.

Came the leper to Christ, 
Saying, "Surely I know
That Thou, Lord, canst make me whole."
When his great faith was seen, Jesus said, "Yes, I will,"
And touched him and made him clean.

Chorus
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

He has healed my sick soul, made me every whit whole,
And He'll do the same for you.
He's the same yesterday and today and for aye,
This Healer of men today.

But downward bends His burning eye
At mysteries so bright

Crown Him the Lord of peace
Whose power a sceptre sways 
From pole to pole that wars may cease
And all be prayer and praise

And round His pierced feet 
Fair flowers of paradise extend 
Their fragrance ever sweet

My web of time He wove,
And aye, the dews of sorrow 
Were lustered by His love;I
'll bless the hand that guided
I'll bless the heart that planned
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O I am my Beloved's 
And my Beloved is mine!
He brings a poor vile sinner 
Into His "house of wine".
I stand upon His merit
I know no other stand,
Not even where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

The Bride eyes not her garment
But her dear Bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory
But on my King of grace.
Not at the crown He giveth
But on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land

I've wrestled on towards Heaven
Against storm and wind and tide,
Now, like a weary traveller
That leaneth on his guide,
Amid the shades of evening
While sinks life's lingering sand,
I hail the glory dawning
From Immanuel's land.

Naught be all else to me save that Thou art

Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true word;

Raise Thou me heavenward,
O Power of my power.

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,
Thou mine inheritance, now and always:
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, after victory's won,
May I reach heaven's joys 
O bright Heaven's Sun!

Still be my vision, O ruler of all.

The words of God are sounding, sounding on the air
Prepare the ground for battle, for God's day has come
Drive back the powers of darkness and march to sounding drum

Long years the land lay shrouded, shrouded in defeat
There was the breath of evil there was satan;s seat
But now the winds are blowing, and darkness flees the plain
The power of God is flowing and many are the slain

Hark to the sounding trumpet, hark to the blaring horn
Now is the day of battle, when many shall be born
Sing now the song of Zion, sing loud the swelling praise
Sing of the glorious lion and loud the anthems raise

Praise Him, praise Him Lord of Glory
Praise Him, praise Him Lord of life
See He rides in triumph victorious in the strife

Crown Him Lord of Glory, Crown Him Lord of life
See the Lord of battles victorious in the strife</attribute>

A day I will never forget
After I wandered in darkness away
Jesus my saviour I met
O, what a tender compassionate Friend
He met the need of my heart
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's family divine
Justified fully thro' Calvary's love
O what a standing is mine
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer
He saved me O praise His dear name


Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time
I have a future in heaven for sure
There in those mansions sublime
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

The solemn hush of nature newly born
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration

So in the stillness Thou beholdest only
Thine image in the waters of my breast

Still, still with Thee
As to each newborn morning
A fresh and solemn splendour still is given
So does this blessed consciousness awaking
Breathe each day nearness
Unto Thee and heaven.

When sinks the soul 
Subdued by toil to slumber
Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer
Sweet the repose beneath thy wings o'er shading
But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there

So shall it be at last

When the soul waketh 
And life's shadows fleeO in that hour

In all of this confusion

Who will touch the fields of shame
And who will light a beacon

With a love that will never die

Oh I, I will carry the fire (repeat)

Who will burn with passion
Blazing from the heart
To forge a new tomorrow
We must tell the world
Of a hope that is eternal
Of a love that will never die

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">There’s a road that is open before us 
And it leads to a world unknown; 
Oft have we pondered its pleasures 
And pictured the heavenly throne. 

We have thought of myriad angels, 
Of harps and of jubilant song; 
We have pictured our Lord and our Saviour 
Where they praise Him all the day long. 

But now our heavenly Guide
Is taking us upward from earth, 
And we’re entering spiritual hallways 
With the sense of a spiritual birth. 

There’s a sensing of realms that we know not 
An acute awareness of need, 
To learn of the things of the Spirit, 
To sit at God’s table and feed. 

The Lamb whom we pictured we see not 
With the eyes of our flesh or our mind, 
But we sense His ineffable nearness 
As He opens the eyes of the blind. 

Instruct us, our God and our Father, 
As we move in this heavenly place;
Teach us the laws of the kingdom 
As we bathe in Thy glory and grace. 

Set our minds firmly on Jesus 
As we search for that radiant face; 
Let our feet go fervently forward 
As we seek for that uttermost place. 

Chorus
Sing we now the song of Jesus, 
Let the vaults of heaven ring, 
Let all nations come and worship 
At the throne of heaven’s king. 

Seek we now the joy of Jesus, 
Seek the deepest wells of life; 
Let us rise and take the kingdom, 
Rise victorious in the strife.</attribute>

And now He reigns triumphant, the goodly crown is won. 
All glory to the Saviour, all glory to the Son.

Within my heart is ringing.

Though the night around me be calling

His voice to me is calling.

Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled when strivings cease
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home

And they went to Africa
To escape the rage of a deadly king
There along the banks of the Nile
Jesus listened to the song
That the captive children used to sing

They were singing

My deliverer is coming
My deliverer is standing by x2

Through a dry and thirsty land
Water for the Kenyan heights
Pours itself out of lake Sanquwas broken heart
There in the Sahara winds 
Jesus heard the whole word cry
For the healing that would flow from His own scars

The world was singing

My deliverer is coming
My deliverer is standing by x2

He will never break his promise
He has written it upon the sky

My deliverer is coming
My deliverer is standing by x2

I will never doubt his promise
Though I doubt by heart
Though I doubt my eyes

My deliverer is coming
My deliverer is standing by x4

He will never break his promise
Though the stars should break faith with the sky

My deliverer is coming
My deliverer is standing by x2

Bind our wounds and set us free;

Lift the burdens, Holy Spirit: 
Heal the scars and staunch the pain, 
By the precious blood of Jesus,
Through the Lamb who once was slain.

When unbelief goes and the church shall awake 
The chains of hard bondage for ever will fall 
And Jesus exalted supreme over all 

By this flowing river earth's bondage shall cease 
The floods are now rising to bring us release 
The vision is glorious then why not believe
Step into the blessing His fullness receive

When He will appear 
And oh we will stand by His side 
A strong pure spotless Bride 

Oh we will dance on  
The streets that are golden 
The glorious Bride
And the great son of Man 
From every tongue and tribe and nation 
Will join in the song of the Lamb

Men-Women echo 
Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near
The risen King our Groom is soon to appear 
The wedding feast to come is now near at hand
Lift up your voice proclaim the coming Lamb

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Deep within there's a fire 
That can't be quenched 
And there's a love for You 
As strong as death 
Hear us Lord 
Hear the longing of our hearts 
We want to be
Where you are and not apart 
We feel You near 
Your presence all around us 
Oh Lord we want to see Your face 
Take us away 

The Spirit and the Bride cry out to You 
Lord we cry out to You come quickly 
We long for the day
When we will see Your face 
We long to be with You come quickly 

And breathe on us until You come 
Breathe on us until You come

Clothe us in Your glory

All you servants of the Lord
Who minister by night within His house 
Lift  up your hands within the sanctuary 
And praise the Lord
 
May the Lord
The maker of heaven and earth 
May the Lord bless you from Zion 
Lift up your hands within the sanctuary 
And praise the Lord

We praise You Lord
We praise You Lord
Hallelujah
We praise You Lord

Not a proud heart not a proud eye 
No concern for things too great for me 
Repeat 

I have stilled my soul like a well fed child
Repeat  

For now and evermore 
For now and evermore 
Hope is in the Lord O Israel 
Repeat 

I have stilled my soul like a well fed child 
Repeat 

And if the Lord had not been on our side 
Would we still be here today 
And if the Lord had not been on our side 
Would we not be swept away 

But like a bird like a bird out from the net 
We have broken free 
Like a bird like a bird out from the net 
We have broken free 
We have broken free x 3 </attribute>

God of heaven living in me 
Gentle Saviour closest friend 
Strong deliverer beginning and end

Your Majesty I can but bow 
I lay my all before You now 
In royal robes I don't deserve 
I live to serve Your Majesty 

Earth and heaven worship You 
God eternal faithful and true 
You bought the nations ransomed souls 
Brought the sinner near to Your throne 
All within me cries out in praise

In royal robes I don't deserve 
I live to serve Your Majesty
